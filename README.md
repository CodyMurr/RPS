## Getting Started
The user's choice is made by clicking one of three images depicting a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. That same click initiates a 100% random choice by the computer, removing any chance for cheating on either side. Player scores are displayed in the top left corner as well as the current number of ties. These can be reset by clicking the aptly-named "reset" button.

## Technologies Used
-Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

-Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)

-Javascript (JS)

This app utilizes DOM manipulation and the MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern in an attempt to reduce the overall amount of code written.

## Next Steps
1. Incorporate sounds and asynchronous functions 

2. Multiplayer option 

3. Responsive Design for mobile integration
